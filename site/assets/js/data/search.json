    "content": "In the state of Maharashtra, core components of economics and policy education are often overlooked in formal academia. This gap in structured learning leaves aspiring academics in a challenging position, expected to acquire these essential skills and knowledge “along the way.” Unfortunately, for many, especially first-generation learners, limited access to resources and learning opportunities hinders their academic progress.Even for experienced academics, there’s a noticeable lack of awareness about valuable online resources that can facilitate a deeper understanding of subjects like econometrics. These resources, which provide insightful and practical guidance, are underutilized within the academic community.In response to these challenges, Eklavya India Foundation has undertaken an initiative to compile a comprehensive set of resources. We believe these materials can be instrumental for those pursuing knowledge in economics and policy. By sharing this resource collection, our goal is to bridge the educational gap and empower first-generation learners to strengthen their academic potential.We invite your feedback to improve and expand this initiative. Please share your suggestions by creating an issue on GitHub.  GitHub Repository: https://github.com/EklavyaEcon  Live Site: https://eklavyaecon.github.io/"

    "content": "Buddhist Homoeconomicusबुद्धाचे स्मितहास्य,काय त्याचे रहस्य?वेद आणि वेदना!बुद्धाचे हे औचित्य,हे कळावया तत्त्व!विश्वाचे विश्वप्रित्यार्थत्याग हेची आदित्य!सत्य हेची सामर्थ्य!काय बुद्धाचे गमक?तो सम्यक साधक!न उच्चलता शस्त्र,गेला सांगून शास्त्र!~ महेश सूर्यवंशीवेद = ज्ञानIn Buddhist terminology, there are two types of desires: the materialistic one, known as “tanha”, and the spiritualistic one, known as “chanda”. The first relates to cravings and attachments, while the second concerns the cultivation of inner peace and self-development (Pyutto, 1992).In the real world, individuals often seek both material well-being and inner peace. Therefore, real consumer preferences could be seen as a blend of “chanda” and “tanha”. However, traditional price theory models primarily focus on “tanha”, which assumes monotonic preferences. This raises an important question: should we incorporate “chanda” preferences into price theory models, especially in light of the increasing emphasis on well-being and mental health in modern economics?What if we extended price theory to include these postulates? Would it become essential in contemporary contexts?A Proposed Utility FunctionIf we were to expand price theory to include both material and spiritual desires, what might a utility function look like? Consider two bundles: X, representing material goods (such as cars), and Y, representing spiritual or mindful goods (such as meditation). From this perspective, these two bundles might be seen as complements for achieving a more fulfilling life.Thus, the utility function could be expressed as:U(X, Y) = Min(X, Y)This utility function suggests that utility is maximized only when there is a balance between material and spiritual consumption. Increasing the consumption of one good alone will not increase utility unless both are present in the right proportions. In essence, harmony between both types of goods is necessary for complete satisfaction.Final ThoughtsThe concept of Buddhist Homoeconomicus challenges us to rethink traditional consumer theory by integrating material and spiritual desires. Incorporating “chanda” into economic models could provide a more holistic understanding of consumer behavior, one that aligns both material fulfillment and inner peace."
