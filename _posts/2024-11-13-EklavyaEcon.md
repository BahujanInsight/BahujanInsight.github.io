In the state of Maharashtra, core components of economics and policy education are often overlooked in formal academia. This gap in structured learning leaves aspiring academics in a challenging position, expected to acquire these essential skills and knowledge "along the way." Unfortunately, for many, especially first-generation learners, limited access to resources and learning opportunities hinders their academic progress.

Even for experienced academics, thereâ€™s a noticeable lack of awareness about valuable online resources that can facilitate a deeper understanding of subjects like econometrics. These resources, which provide insightful and practical guidance, are underutilized within the academic community.

In response to these challenges, **Eklavya India Foundation** has undertaken an initiative to compile a comprehensive set of resources. We believe these materials can be instrumental for those pursuing knowledge in economics and policy. By sharing this resource collection, our goal is to bridge the educational gap and empower first-generation learners to strengthen their academic potential.

We invite your feedback to improve and expand this initiative. Please share your suggestions by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/EklavyaEcon).
